Let L $\in$ BP $\cdot$ NP.

$\exists$TM T and $\exists$Integer k such that:

$\forall x \forall R$ T(x,R) halts in $\mid x \mid^k$ steps

x $\in$ L iff prob(T(x,R) $\in$ 3-SAT) $\geq$ 3/4

x $\notin$ L iff prob(T(x,R) $\in$ 3-SAT) $\leq$ 1/4

First off, we will ignore the second tape in this T.

We will create our circuit C to accept two inputs (x,y) with x being an encoding of T.

The y will be hardwired to be our correct set R. Below is how we will build this correct set.

If this machine is run $n^2$ times, then the prob(T is wrong) becomes $<$ $1/4^n$ according
to statistics.

If we get wrong answers, we can simply throw them away. We build R from the correct set.

By the union bound, $\forall n$, $\exists$ R such that $\forall$ x $\mid x \mid$ = n implies 
T(x, R) is correct. We just need to find an R that works.

$\exists C_n$ family of circuits $\{C_n\}_{n \geq 1}$ such that

L $\in$ NP/Poly
