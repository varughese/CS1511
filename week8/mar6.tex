Lemma 7.12 says that 
A coin with Pr[Heads] = ρ 
can be simulated by a PTM in 
expected time O(1) provided the 
ith bit of ρ is computable in 
poly(i) time.

We can construct this p such that 
a random coin that comes up with this probability
will make a Turing Machine able to 
decide a language in undecidable time.

Assume that this is possible to make a PTM 
that simulates a coin flip with probability p. The ith
bit of p can be computed in constant time.

The p is comprised of 1s and 0s. The turing machine
in question (say TM T) generates a random "x". This 
x is a random variable. Then we compare x to that
probability p. We do this by comparing bit
by bit. If p is 0.0101010 and x is 0.0101011, 
we know that x has a greater probability than 
p.

We make each bit of this p represent whether a 
Turing Machine will halt on a particular language.
So, order every Turing Machine and input w
like (M,w) and correspond it with a integer. 
The ith integer in p will be a 1 if M halts on w
and 0 if not.

Then, the Turing Machine T could solve the halting
problem. To figure out if M halts on w,
it would first correspond that M,w pair to an integer.
Call this integer i. The ith digit of p would tell
us what the answer to this question is. So we flip 
We flip a coin i times. We count the 
distribution of heads and tails. We can say with p 
confidence whether or not M halts w.

First we show NP $\in$ PP. Then we show coNP $\in$ PP.
