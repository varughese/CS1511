\problem{19. a}

EXACT INDSET = \{$<G, k> $= : the largest independent set in G has size exactly k\}.

To show EXACT INDSET $\in$ $\pi_2^p$, we need to demonstrate two things.

$\forall x \forall y \forall z$ T(x, y, z) runs in time $\mid x \mid^k$

$\forall x \exists y$ T(x, y, z) accepts iff x $\in$ EXACT INDSET

Our language will now become $\forall x$, with x being an independent set
of G, $\exists w$ where w is the largest independent set of size exactly k.

To solve this in poly-time, we will need 3 read-only tapes and 1 work tape, 
which is based on a simple scaling from our 2 read-only 1 work tape model
with $\pi_1^p$.

\problem{19. b}

SUCCINCT SET-COVER = \{$<S, n, k> $= : There is a subset of the collection of 3-DNF formulas S on n variables called S' where
S' evaluates to 1 for every assignment to its k variables\}.

To show SUCCINCT SET-COVER $\in$ $\Sigma_2^p$, we need to demonstrate two things.

$\forall x \forall y \forall z$ T(x, y, z) runs in time $\mid x \mid^k$

$\exists x \forall y$ T(x, y, z) accepts iff x $\in$ SUCCINCT SET-COVER

Our language will now become $\exists S'$, with S' being a subset of S, where
$\forall w$ combinations of k variable assignments, the formula evaluates to 1.

To solve this in poly-time, we will need 3 read-only tapes and 1 work tape, 
which is based on a simple scaling from our 2 read-only 1 work tape model
with $\Sigma_1^p$.

\problem{19. c}

VC-DIMENSION = \{$<C, k> $= : C represents a collection S s.t. VC(S) $\geq$ k\}.

To show VC-DIMENSION $\in$ $\Sigma_3^p$, we need to demonstrate two things.

$\forall x \forall y \forall z \forall  w$ T(x, y, z, w) runs in time $\mid x \mid^k$

$\exists x \forall y \exists z$ T(x, y, z, w) accepts iff x $\in$ VC-DIMENSION

Our language will now become $\exists C$, a Boolean circuit that $\forall X'$, where
X' a subset of the size of the largest set, $\exists i$ such that subset Si of S has an intersection
with X' that equals k and C(i, x) = 1.

To solve this in poly-time, we will need 4 read-only tapes and 1 work tape, 
which is based on a simple scaling from our 3 read-only 1 work tape model
with $\Sigma_2^p$.

\problem{20. a}

3SAT = \{$<\phi> $= : $\phi$ is a satisfiable 3CNF formula\}.

To reduce 3SAT to its complement, we need to have an algorithm for 
3SAT that makes a call to its complement and runs in polynomial time.

Here is the algorithm.

L $\in$ 3SAT

$\phi \in$ L iff $\phi \in $ the compliment of 3SAT

Call to L($\phi$)

$\phi_2= \neg \phi$

Call to complement 3SAT($\phi_2$)

This would mean that $\Sigma_n^p$ = $\pi_n^p$ with n = 1, and then
for any n $\geq$ 1 we could define n TM's, with each having a one-to-one
correspondence with their respective oracles of $\Sigma_n^p$. Then, we could
say a TM M is a concatenation of M1  ... Mn to prove that $\Sigma_n^p$ answers yes
iff M does so.

If this would be possible in polynomial time, then we could take
any element in NP, change it to its compliment, run an algorithm 
in co-NP with that element and show reducability in poly-time. 

The same could be done with any element in co-NP, which would
therefore make the languages equal.

Also NP $\in \Sigma_1^p$ and co-NP $\in \pi_1^p$, so if the two sets of
languages were equal then NP would equal co-NP by definition.


\problem{20. b}

With the same logic as the previous problem, the hierarchy would
eventually collapse so that any $\Sigma_n^p$ could equal any $\pi_n^p$ 
for the n=1 that the hierarchy collapses to. This would be a proof by induction
that repeats the previous problem for all complexity classes. In this complete collapse
to the bottom of the hierarchy, the union of all class PH would now be able to equal
NP.
