\problem{33. a)}
The verifier could simulate say 1000 trials of the prover and pick the majority answer.
Since the verifier is a BPP machine it still will error with low probability
if the prover sends an incorrect result.

\problem{33. b)}
We have polynomial space so verifier writes down every
possible thing to ask. This can be done in polynomial space.
Then, it keeps track of the maximum probability. 

\problem{33. c)}
IP is in PSPACE. So, changing the 2/3 to 1 does not matter.

\problem{33. d)}
This means that the verifier always rejects when a string
is not in the language. Since the verifier can ask 
a polynomial number questions, this means that enough trials
can be made to know if it is the language. So, IP' = NP.

\problem{34}
Prove that there exists a perfectly complete $AM[O(1)]$ protocol for proving a lower bound on set size.

Hint: First note that in the current set lower bound protocol we can have the prover choose
the hash function. Consider the easier case of constructing a protocol to distinguish
between the case $|S| \geq $ K and $|S| \leq $  1K where c>2 can even be a function of K. c
If c is large enough, we can allow the prover to use several hash functions h1 , . . . , hi , and
it can be proven that if $i$ is large enough, weâ€™ll have $\cup_i hi(S)={0,1}k$.The gap 
can be increased by considering instead of S the set Sl, that is the $l$ times cartesian product of S.
