AM = \{ (M, p, q, I) $\mid \exists$ TM M, $\exists$ polynomial p $\exists$ polynomial q and input I such that:

M runs in poly-time

if x $\in$ L, then $Pr_{y \in \{0,1\}^{p(n)}}(\exists z \in \{0, 1\}^{q(n)} M(x,y,z) = 1) \geq 2/3$

if x $\notin$ L, then $Pr_{y \in \{0,1\}^{p(n)}}(\forall z \in \{0, 1\}^{q(n)} M(x,y,z) = 0) \geq 2/3$

MAM = \{ (M, x, y, R, I) $\mid \exists$ TM M, $\exists$ polynomial x $\exists$ polynomial y and input I such that:

M runs in poly-time

if x $\in$ L, then $Pr_{y \in \{0,1\}^{x(n)}}(\exists z \in \{0, 1\}^{y(n)} M(x,R,y) = 1) \geq 2/3$

Where in MAM Merlin send an x, Arthur replies with a random bits R, and Merlin sends back a y.

L $\in$ MAM

When Arthur sends random bits to Merlin in the MAM protocol, there's a chance that he sends
bits that are incorrect. If Arthur sends $m^2$ bits back, the chance the he is wrong is $1/4^m$. Here is how we do this.
According to the Chernoff bound, with k independent unfair coin flips with our probability of $2/3$
correctness, the expected number of heads is $2k/3$. Our chances that there's more than $10\%$ more or less than
$10\%$ less is at most $2 * e^{-(p)^2 * k/3}$. Thus, the chances that we get more than $10\%$ more would be 
$2/(\sqrt[27]{e^{4k}})$, which will be equal to one in a polynomial amount of coin tosses k.
The expected number of tails would be $1k/3$, so we have a majority
of heads. If through a union bound we continue to take the majority each time we do these coin flips,
the probability that we send an incorrect answer is less than one. In this way, we do not need Merlin
to send us a first x, and our language is now just Arthur sending a ton of coin flips in parallel at once
to Merlin and having Merlin still respond since he already does that in MAM, which is in AM.
